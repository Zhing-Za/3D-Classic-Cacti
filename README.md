  Minecraft resource pack for a 3D version of the old cacti textures
</p>
 
---

 Do you dislike the new cactus textures that were in the 1.14 texture update? Well, I did, so I made this resource pack. This resource pack brings back the cacti textures from before the 1.14 texture update. Though this isn't all that it does; it also adds more three-dimensional depth to them. The thorns on the side and top are extruded. If you want a version of this for the modern textures, there is [a resource pack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/3d-cactus-4425631/) made by the user [Technodono](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/technodono/) on Planet Minecraft.
